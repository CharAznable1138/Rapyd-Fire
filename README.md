# Rapyd-Fire
"Rapyd Fire" is the working title for a 2D sidescrolling platformer game I'm working on, meant to recapture the simple run n' gun feel of perennial classics like Contra.

This will be a single-player game, multiplayer features are not currently planned

There will be multiple levels in this game (exact amount TBD)

A typical level will involve:
 * progressing from the far left to the far right
 * jumping from platform to platform
 * eliminating enemies impeding the player's prograss forward (read: to the right)
   * basic enemies will be enemy soldiers armed with guns, who will attempt to kill the player character by running towards the player character while firing their guns
   * other enemy types TBD
 * surpassing simple hazards (hazards = environmental objects that will damage or kill the player character if not timed/navigated properly, compare to an obstacle course)
 * power-up(s) that provide minor, temporary boost(s) to the player's power
 * TODO: Decide whether or not to include health packs
   * This decision will hinge on whether we decide to include a health bar or else kill the player character instantly after a single hit a la Contra
 * TODO: Definitively decide whether or not to include boss battles. If not, each level will end with one last onslaught of enemies to defeat
 
 Controls (PC):
 * Up arrow/W = aims the player character's gun upward
 * Left arrow/A = moves the player character left
 * Right arrow/D = moves the player character right
 * Down arrow/S = makes the player character crouch
   * Down arrow/S while midair/jumping = aims the player character's gun downward
 * Space Bar = makes the player character jump
 * Left Click on Mouse = discharges the player character's weapon
